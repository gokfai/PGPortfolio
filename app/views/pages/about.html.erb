        <p>Education and learning have been core values of mine my whole life.
       Exploring and applying education strategies are vital!<br>
       Effective learning strategies can scale up from a very young age, into the classroom, and on into professional development.<br>
       Goals within the various students I work with include
       helping them discover and use their most effective learning techniques, 
       making sure everything they learn is always relevant to them, 
       and constantly building bridges between what they already know 
       and what they are about to learn.<br></p>

        <p>High quality education must be offered from childhood on into adult life.<br>
          Professional development where language is fundamental to any successful career.</p>
        <p>
        In the classroom, I want to help unlock the students' ability to learn and grasp new and challenging concepts.<br>
        In a language learning environment, I would like to teach you English.<br>
        If you want to use Mandarin, Cantonese, or ASL to help you get there,<br>
        I would be very excited to be your English instructor<br>
        as these languages are all very dear to me and a part of my daily communication.
