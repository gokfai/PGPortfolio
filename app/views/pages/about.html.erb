        <p>Education and learning have been core values of mine my whole life.
       Exploring and applying education strategies are vital!<br>
       Effective learning strategies can scale up from a very young age, into the classroom, and on into professional development.<br>
       Goals within the various students I work with include
       helping them discover and use their most effective learning techniques, 
       making sure everything they learn is always relevant to them, 
       and constantly building bridges between what they already know 
       and what they are about to learn.<br></p>

        <p>Besides supporting students with their learning goals, I have also sought to acquire other skills including website development
          using Ruby on Rails, with Javascript and HTML integration.<br>
          Further professional endeavors include vehicle imports into Canada, auto detailing, and general residential renovation trade skills.</p>
        <p>Language learning has also been a primary goal for me, with an extensive background of ASL, Mandarin and Cantonese.
          These skills have proved to be invaluable in the field of education, in addition to daily communication, cultural enrichment and
          ongoing personal development.</p>
